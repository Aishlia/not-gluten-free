- janky solution to not displaying the animation sequence, tons of errors
- Added animate(shapes) for the function decleration and the requestAnimationFrame things
- SUBSTANTIALLY reduced run time, like, by a lot
- only the start/resume buttom works, and it only starts
  - refesh to reset
- The start: no animation has a function behind it but it doesnt work,
  - Make running with/without animation an option
